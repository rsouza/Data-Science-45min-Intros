Specifically, we're going to look at breaking down an observed time series into components that represent underlying trends and seasonality. Additionally, we'll write and use an \"STL decomposition\" because it's a nice interpretable model that doesn't exist in `statsmodels` and I think it should. \n\n\nThe general outline we'll follow is:\n- start with a motivating example (\"start with the answer\")\n- build our own version to see how it works\n- look at any alternative implementation\n\nConsistent with earlier parts of the series, [the OText content on forecasting](https://www.otexts.org/fpp) is a great reference, and we'll follow some of the conventions there, particularly Chapter 6.5.","metadata":{"cell_id":"ba642d1bfdee4856912bd27e4c82d986","editable":true,"deletable":true,"deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport scipy as sp\nimport statsmodels.api as sm\nimport matplotlib\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n%matplotlib inline\nmatplotlib.rc('figure', figsize=(10,8))","metadata":{"cell_id":"4ee92f9bd20847c1af87b15fcaa3f39a","editable":true,"collapsed":false,"deletable":true,"deepnote_cell_type":"code"},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Decomposing a time series\n\n\nIn the previous parts of this series, our modeling (and forecasting) efforts often ignored most of the data in our time series. Our predictions were either simply based on the last-observed point, or a single point some relatively small distance in the past. \n\nNow, we'll consider larger-scale patterns in the time series data. Often these patterns are described in terms of a decomposition into \"components.\" The set of components we'll refer to in this session is:\n\n- trend: long-term (low-frequency, large-period), low-variance changes in the data \n- seasonal: fixed-period (or frequency) fluctuations in the data (day, week, month, etc)\n- residual (or error): any difference remaining after the previous components are removed from observed data\n\nWe can write out the combined model as:\n\n`y = S + T + E,` if the model is additive\n\nor\n\n`y = S * T * E,` if the model is multiplicative.\n\n\nThe additive model makes sense when the magnitude of the seasonal component doesn't vary with the absolute level of the series, and the multiplicative model makes sense when that variation is present. This is often an emperical choice, and the additive model is often the default setting.\n\nThe specific implementation of both the \"trend\" and \"seasonal\" components are variable, and we'll look at a couple of examples below.\n\n\n# Get some data\n\nLike many libraries, statsmodels has some datasets built-in.

In this example, it looks like relatively random, zero-centered jitters, at a level that is a fraction of a percent of the observations. That's good!\n\n\n\n**Note**: inspecting the data for most significant periodicity is important! By default, statsmodels looks inside the pandas frame, and [maps the frequency of the index to a filter frequency](http://www.statsmodels.org/stable/_modules/statsmodels/tsa/tsatools.html#freq_to_period). Sounds reasonable, but here, the daily data leads to a filter function that is \"7\" e.g. a weekly smoothing. However, our data doesn't have weekly periodicity so the trend ends up overfit (see charts just below). We have to look at our data observe that the major periodicity is annual, so (above) we set the frequency to 365 (number in indices given the units of the observed data).","metadata":{"cell_id":"a35b950936c8499882599836e258ee08","editable":true,"deletable":true,"deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# default settings -> read the pd.datetimeindex freq (1 day), assumes weekly cycles\nseas_decomp = seasonal_decompose(co2_ts)\n\n# overfit!\nseas_decomp.plot();","metadata":{"cell_id":"fb98934a4bef42eb91c04bf739c456e0","editable":true,"collapsed":false,"deletable":true,"deepnote_cell_type":"code"},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Build it ourselves\n\nRecall, we have basically two goals:\n\n- calculate and subtract trend (smooth)\n- calculate and subtract seasonality\n\n\n### Trend component\n\nThe `seasonal_decompose` method isn't technically an \"STL\" (Seasonal Trend with Lowess) decomposition because it doesn't use the Loess method (more on this soon), but it does decompose the signal into a seasonal and trend component. The `statsmodels` function uses a convolution between the observed data and a filter (roughly, a square wave) defined by the specified frequency of the seasonal component. \n\nThe method will introspect a dataframe for the frequency of it's datetimeindex, but you may have to manually override it. If you have a month of daily sales data, the largest seasonal component is probably weekly. In our example, we have years of daily weather data and the biggest seasonal component is the annual one (365). You could imagine using a Fourier Transform to identify the largest seasonal component automatically, but this is left as an exercise for the reader. \n\nSo what is a [convolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolution)? Generally it's an operation that takes two functions, and produces another. Roughly, it's the integral of the pointwise multiplication of the two functions as a function of the amount that one of the original functions is translated. I always remember it best as \"smearing one curve across another while dragging it from left to right.\" I find this figure (from the wiki page) helpful.\n\n<img src='misc/conv.png' width=500>\n\nWe don't have to go so far as writing our own convolution. This one from statsmodels is built around the relevant tools from scipy. Below, I'll follow, briefly, what the `seasonal_decompose()` method is doing under the hood. Don't get too hung up on the concept of the convolution; it's just one way to smooth the observed data into a trend that happens to account for variation over a particular window size. We'll look at another example shortly.\n\nWe'll calculate a few things, then plot them all together for comparison.","metadata":{"cell_id":"a2870fe11b034dbaad2b6403b4db39b3","editable":true,"deletable":true,"deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from statsmodels.tsa.filters.filtertools import convolution_filter","metadata":{"cell_id":"542142df59e2487abe26037e71f1d3ac","editable":true,"collapsed":true,"deletable":true,"deepnote_cell_type":"code"},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# the filter size (units = # of data points)\nfreq = 365\n\n# an array that is a square wave from 0 to freq\nfilt = np.repeat(1./freq, freq)\n#filt","metadata":{"cell_id":"ec8cafc5f4c84cb0958509d5784bb1df","editable":true,"collapsed":true,"deletable":true,"deepnote_cell_type":"code"},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# number of data points to include in inspection charts\nnobs = 2000","metadata":{"cell_id":"727b95dbb1854886b99534cf9ca5256f","editable":true,"collapsed":true,"deletable":true,"deepnote_cell_type":"code"},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# convert our dataframe of observations to 1-d np.array\nobserved = np.asanyarray(co2_ts).squeeze()\n\nobserved[:nobs]","metadata":{"cell_id":"4104dd25f91b49bf9c5527ddeb40e39c","editable":true,"scrolled":true,"collapsed":false,"deletable":true,"deepnote_cell_type":"code"},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# calculate the \"trend\" array by dragging filter across data\ntrend = convolution_filter(observed, filt)\n\n#trend[:nobs]","metadata":{"cell_id":"ca703ac4e7974bcf82e55cf9deca370a","editable":true,"collapsed":true,"deletable":true,"deepnote_cell_type":"code"},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# subtract the trend array (\"standardize\" values)\ndetrended = observed - trend\n\n# these values should be closer to 0\ndetrended[:nobs]","metadata":{"cell_id":"a77d508ba73342fc9f586ad77da6fc3d","editable":true,"collapsed":false,"deletable":true,"deepnote_cell_type":"code"},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"code","source":"fig, axes = plt.subplots(31, sharex=True)\n\n# filter\nplt.subplot(311)\n# note: i'm artificially adding a bunch of 0s to the filter here so we can see it on the same x scale\nplt.plot(np.append(filt, np.array([0]*(nobs - len(filt)))), '.-', label='filter')\nplt.title(\"first {} observed data points\".format(nobs))\nplt.legend()\n\n# trend\nplt.subplot(312)\nplt.plot(observed[:nobs], '.-', label='observed')\nplt.plot(trend[:nobs], '.-', label='trend')\nplt.legend()\n\n# standardized / de-trended\nplt.subplot(313)\nplt.plot(detrended[:nobs], '.-', label='detrended')\nplt.legend()","metadata":{"cell_id":"aa45fa64bbd64ed780c76a4ea62fc681","editable":true,"collapsed":false,"deletable":true,"deepnote_cell_type":"code"},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Seasonal component\n\nNow we use the detrended series to find the seasonal component.

There are many libraries full of advanced methods for time series forecasting in Python (and we'll likely see some later in this series!), but not as many that are simple. I value simplicity and interpretability, both of which I think STL embodies.

It's an underutilized tool (I think) that also shows up in e.g. [ggplot](http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_smooth.html#examples), and now [seaborn](http://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.lmplot.html).

But it's also a good example of where the seasonal component is not the overwhelmingly dominant feature. In this case, the daily (and weekly) fluctuations are of the same size (or bigger than) the modelled seasonal component. \n\nAnother thing to observe with this model is the effect of the `lo_frac` term - that is, how narrow the bandwidth is used in the Lowesss trend.

But, with some tuning and observation, this is one relatively straightforward method of forecasting a time series. \n\n\n# Wrap-up\n\n\nIn summary, STL decompositions are pretty handy, and relatively efficient. \n\nPro\n- interpretable \n- flexible and robust\n- arbitrary timescales and seasonality\n- takes advantage more of the observations\n\nCon\n- doesn't account for transient events\n- can be inefficient\n- still requires an expert to identify most important frequency, and Lowess bandwidth\n","metadata":{"cell_id":"cebd27c11bda409696fd4157aba48b85","editable":true,"collapsed":true,"deletable":true,"deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{"cell_id":"6f39b505db414e529307fd9627630207","editable":true,"collapsed":true,"deletable":true,"deepnote_cell_type":"code"},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a style='text-decoration:none;line-height:16px;display:flex;color:#5B5B62;padding:10px;justify-content:end;' href='https://deepnote.com?utm_source=created-in-deepnote-cell&projectId=9866f617-4cda-4da2-9f50-5010108b8b9f' target=\"_blank\">\n<img alt='Created in deepnote.com' style='display:inline;max-height:16px;margin:0px;margin-right:7.5px;' src='data:image/svg+xml;base64,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' > </img>\nCreated in <span style='font-weight:600;margin-left:4px;'>Deepnote</span></a>","metadata":{"tags":[],"created_in_deepnote_cell":true,"deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}}],"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0,"metadata":{"deepnote":{},"kernelspec":{"name":"python3","language":"python","display_name":"Python 3"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.5.1","mimetype":"text/x-python","file_extension":".py","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"nbconvert_exporter":"python"},"deepnote_notebook_id":"1a106fdadad740e182bb7d567283b870","deepnote_execution_queue":[]}}
